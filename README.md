This project is a collection of networking labs and configurations created with Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It demonstrates key networking concepts and skills, including:

- **DHCP** – automatic IP address assignment and configuration  
- **OSPF** – dynamic routing using the Open Shortest Path First protocol  
- **VLAN** – network segmentation and inter-VLAN communication  

## Purpose
The portfolio was built to practice and showcase networking knowledge in a simulated environment.  
It can serve as a reference for studying, troubleshooting, and preparing for networking certifications.

## Tools
- Cisco Packet Tracer (latest version recommended)

## How to Use
1. Download and open the `.pkt` files in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
2. Review the topology and configurations.  
3. Experiment with the setup by modifying, testing, or extending the networks.
